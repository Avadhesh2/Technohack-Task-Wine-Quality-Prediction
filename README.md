## Introduction

Wine Quality Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical features. In this project, we will use a dataset containing different attributes of wines along with their quality ratings. By training a machine learning model on this data, we can make predictions about the quality of new, unseen wines.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various red and white wines. Each wine sample has several input features such as acidity, residual sugar, pH, alcohol content, etc. The quality of each wine is rated on a scale from 1 to 10. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be found at [dataset_link](https://example.com/wine_dataset.csv).

## Project Overview

The Wine Quality Prediction project involves the following steps:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: Reading the dataset, exploring the data's structure, and gaining insights into the features and target variable.

2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling the features, encoding categorical variables (if any), and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. Model Selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for the wine quality prediction task. We may experiment with various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.

4. Model Training: Training the selected machine learning model on the preprocessed training data.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model's performance using suitable evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, etc.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional): Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

7. Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen wine samples.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (>= 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebook)

Ensure you have the required libraries installed by using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Wine-Quality-Prediction.git
cd Wine-Quality-Prediction
```

2. Install the dependencies as mentioned in the Requirements section.

3. Download the dataset from [dataset_link](https://example.com/wine_dataset.csv) and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

The main notebook (e.g., `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`) contains the step-by-step implementation of the project. Open the notebook using Jupyter and execute each cell to run the project.

## Model Training

The model training is performed in the notebook. We will explore different algorithms, preprocess the data, and train the model on the training data.

## Evaluation

After training the model, we will evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. The evaluation results will help us assess how well the model can predict the wine quality.

## Results

The results obtained from the model evaluation will be discussed and analyzed in the notebook. We will also present visualizations to better understand the model's performance.
